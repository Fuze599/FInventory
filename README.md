An inventory for Garry's Mod with backpack, a backpack vendor, bank to save items, inventory checker for police officers and an administration panel to manage player inventories. The addon is very customizable and compatible with all gamemodes (with advantages for DarkRP).

# Description

Having been a DarkRP server owner years ago, I had never really been happy with inventories. So I decided to develop an addon that matched my criteria of yesteryear.

For my dream inventory, I imagined:

- An inventory with a sober and dark design.
- A backpack system with custom models.
- A Backpack Vendor NPC.
- A simple and hassle-free item bank.
- A search system for professions related to the police.
- An efficient admin panel to view and delete player inventories.

# Features

This addon offers a multitude of tools to manage, control or even store a player's objects. If you are looking for a complete inventory system, you are in the right place!

✔️ The choice of using sweps or commands (/inventory, /pickup, /inspect) to interact with inventory

✔️ Three custom backpack models

✔️ Easy to add new backpack

✔️ You can drop your backpack

✔️ Simple or advanced saving system

✔️ Automatic adding of items in the F4

✔️ Support DarkRP items

✔️ Material design

✔️ Easy theme customization

✔️ Item name configuration

✔️ Custom bank model

✔️ Bank to store items

✔️ English, Turkish and French language support (Feel free to submit other languages)

✔️ Custom vault model for the item bank

✔️ Backpack vendor

✔️ Illegal items system

✔️ Search system for illegal items

✔️ Limited time to search an inventory

✔️ Drop inventory on death

✔️ Administration tool

✔️ You can delete anyone's inventory when you are admin

# Installation and configuration

If you want to configure the addon correctly, it will be easier to add it manually to your server. But here is the addon on my steam Workshop : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3118163494

Once you have downloaded the addon, you are ready to now install and configure it.

1. Download the addon from github.
2. Extract the zip file and place it in the addons folder.
3. Configure the addon (lua/finventory/sh/config.lua).
4. Place the workshop content in your server collection.
5. Done!

# What I will do in the future

- Show backpacks in spawn menu instead of vendor.
- An in-game configuration menu.
- Make sure you have items that take up more than one place in the inventory.

# Help and support

Feel free to ask question, it will be a pleasure for me to satisfy your request! There are probably bugs in this initial version of the addon. You can either add me on Steam or add me on discord under the name: gaetanlesinge (I am more active on discord than on steam)
